## Gear I'm Researching

|Item|Type|Price|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|[Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus Isolated Power Supply](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/PedalPwr2Pls--voodoo-lab-pedal-power-2-plus-8-output-isolated-guitar-pedal-power-supply)|Power supply|$180|8 isolated outputs some with 9/12v and voltage sag, 1100mA output. More expensive than the CS6 listed above (and maybe a little bigger physically) but potentially has the option to plug another power supply into the back of it?|
|[MOOER Radar Guitar Speaker Simulator](https://www.amazon.com/MOOER-Radar-Guitar-Speaker-Simulator/dp/B07B27KN2W)|Pedal|$150|Emulates various amps and mics instead of using just the dry tone of the guitar/pedalboard. Would love to get eventually, but not for my first pedalboard.|
|[JHS Clover](https://www.jhspedals.info/clover)|Pedal|$200|Preamp/EQ in a pedal. Might be good to get something like this eventually, but only after I'm comfortable enough with guitar playing that it would actually make a difference for my tone.|
|[BOSS CS-3](https://www.boss.info/us/products/cs-3/specifications/)|Compressor|[$100](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/CS3--boss-cs-3-compression-sustainer-pedal)|Will be good to have eventually, but not while I'm still learning. I don't want to get in the habit of relying on a pedal to keep the volume of my strumming consistent.|
|[BOSS GE-7](https://www.boss.info/us/products/ge-7/specifications/)|Pedal|[$120](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/GE7--boss-ge-7-7-band-eq-pedal)|Would be helpful to boost volumes and tweak sounds (not sure if near the beginning or end of chain, probably beginning?)|
|[Cry Baby Mini Wah (CBM95)](https://www.jimdunlop.com/content/manuals/CBM95.pdf)|Pedal|[$100](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/CrybabyMini--dunlop-cbm95-cry-baby-mini-wah-pedal)|Has a small footprint but I wonder if it would be difficult to work with if I have another pedal above it on my board.|
